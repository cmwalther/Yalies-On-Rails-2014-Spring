**Due: Wednesday, May 29th, 4pm**

## Reading 

You should start by reading the following in [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book):

* Chapters 2-3
* Sections 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1

You should then read or at least closely skim [this post on a git branching workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). We won't be using this workflow quite yet, but I think it's nice to see what you can do with git and branches, and why we care about this sort of thing.

## Challenge

Your 'challenge' (the part you have to submit) is to split up into four teams (of 3-4 people), and build a team site containing all the members' sites. You should fork the [Assignment #3](https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/assignment3) repository to use as your working repo.

The team site should have a way to navigate between the members of the team, into their specific pages. Bonus points for somehow integrating the design of the various sites into one coherent design.

You should make heavy use of git and probably create branches for each person as you begin the work, and then merge everything into the master branch.

On Wednesday at 4, each team will present their site and discuss their strategies for working together (what worked and what didn't, etc).
