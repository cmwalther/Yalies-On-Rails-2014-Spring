## Challenge

Your challenge for this assignment is to select and solve one puzzle from the 15 available at [PuzzleNode](http://www.puzzlenode.com) (using Ruby).

You *must* form teams of two (one team may have 3 people to make the numbers work) and work together on this assignment. You will submit your work as a team, and present your solution to the class.

Each team should choose a different puzzle, and note which puzzle you have chosen by updating this wiki article. *(Note that puzzles #1 and #2 may be confusing due to errors in the original wording that required numerous updates. You may want to choose from #3-#15)*

To start, one member of the team should fork [this repo](https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/assignment5), and add their teammate as a collaborator.
