YConnect: An app for Yalies to - depending on user preference - schedule lunches with one of a predetermined subset of Facebook friends (friendlist drawn from Facebook and then narrowed down by each user) OR a blind date with another compatible Yalie (a Yalie who may or may not be a facebook friend of theirs but who has some things in common as determined via Facebook). These matches would mostly be based on what times/days each of the users are available, preferred dining halls or general area that they are available, and goals for lunch. The app would be opt-in each day so that users can avoid the fear of making commitments more than a few hours in advance. - Andrew

Similar to Andrew's idea, but with groups of people instead of only two, (similar to Grouper) and doing activities that include things other than lunch.

More comprehensive "Is it chicken tenders day?" site. Imagine that you always go to lunch in Berkeley. But you love Philly Cheese steaks, which are only served in commons. What do you do? No worries, you just go eat lunch in Berkeley, as usual, because you had filled out a form on an app that will email you when it is Philly Cheese steak day, and what dining hall it is in! - Natalia

App for streamlining hectic Yale schedules- Allows you to enter events such as classes or sports practices on a calendar and alerts you when you need to leave your current location to make it to the event on time. Other features could include assignment tracking with prompts to create study sessions with classmates before tests and assignment due dates, shuttle integration in travel time, and the ability to enter you schedule to automatically create events rather than individual class locations (pending university approval). -- Jacob

Brolo, or perhaps Yulu The first being a version of Lulu with reversed gender roles. Foreseeing potential ethical dilemmas, an alternative would be Yulu (Yale Lulu) which would allow people to rate other people regardless of gender (the stipulation being that you can only rate people whose gender aligns with your sexual preference). Rating criteria should stay away from superficial characteristics and instead offer insight into a rated persons personality. --Jacob

Rental Map - use scrapping from various services to get aggregate rental prices and displays it as a heat map. Also can calculate rental inflation with enough historical data. This will tell users how close to mean price a particular apt is. --cheong

An app that takes into account a lot of data about where you live and finds the cheapest form of energy for your individualized roof in your specific area with a specific average weather pattern and so on. Then, it gives you an auto generated detailed plan of exactly how to get this energy source if it's not what you currently have, including how to choose the best installer, what permits you need, and what not. This app can also connect you to the cheapest providers in your area for that energy source. --Gabe

An app that crawls the web for all the info a building manager of a university building needs to consider installing solar panels, and autogenerates a report and emails it to the building manager (I'm not sure if this is possible, but it would be sweet) --Gabe

Make a better personal history search engine. Possible features could include: If you search the web for armadillo, it can alert you in a side bar that not too long ago, you were on a porcupine web page. Basically, it recognizes similar searches and brings up relevant history stuff. This would be huge for me, I lose so much information to closing tabs. --Gabe

Document my life gives the user stats on everything he or she does. Hours spent watching netflix, when they went to sleep, what they ate, workouts they did, and so on. This could be displayed in a very cool visual representation, act as a way to help people improve their habits and work towards their goals, and also serve as a sort of journal for people looking back on their lives. --Gabe (QUICK UPDATE, WE WOULD BE COMPETING WITH THE GUY WHO INVENTED WOLFRAM ALPHA, BUT HE IS DOING SOME DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS, SO ESPECIALLY IF WE INCORPORATE DATA ABOUT WHERE YOU GO USING GOOGLE MAPS, WE WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ENOUGH PRODUCT.)

Collaborative drawing app that pairs two people chatroulette style. This would be done with node and paper.js (http://paperjs.org/). If the real time features are too difficult to implement then it could be simplified to just saving the state of drawings that other people can then contribute to (paper.js supports persistence through JSON). Could be a nice experiment to dig a bit deeper into javascript. --Eric

An app to make big lectures/speaker events more interactive. Participants would check-in at a lecture hall and submit questions to the speaker. Or the speaker could ask a question and solicit real time responses (no need to check-out clickers from Bass/ professors won't need to limit questions to multiple choice). Possible features: voting on students' questions/ answers. --Raph

Memorium: A personal memorial website for dead people. Can be linked to via QR code on tombstone (or funeral invitations, etc.). Heavy mobile emphasis.
--Aaron

Betterfy: An app that rewards you for signing up for websites/apps which improve productivity and such. Especially useful for people who aren't tech-savvy or who are new to the web (older folks, children). --Aaron

QuizMe: App to help you remember and internalize things you've read and enjoyed (or stuff you need to know for tests). Highlight important bits of articles/ebooks, set up quiz links based on them, have the quizzes sent to you on a spaced-repetition schedule, etc. --Aaron

LifeBubbles: Social network for extremely specific interests, that lets you classify yourself according to several different categories. i.e. "I'm a doctor interested in South American parasites" -- and people can find you who are looking to befriend doctors, or parasite geeks, or South America aficionados, etc. Basically, helps make social networking and forums less broad, by bringing together people with specific areas of expertise. --Aaron
