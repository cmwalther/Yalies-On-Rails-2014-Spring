### What is LunchtYme?
Yalies are insanely busy. The lunch hour (between 11:30 and 1:30) is a time that is utilized differently by everyone. Some eat with residential college friends, some decompress alone, some finish up class readings while eating a quick sandwich, and some haven't even woken up yet. But for those Yalies who want to catch up with friends, it can be challenging to work out the logistics given that their friends are scattered across campus and in classrooms for different sections of that two-hour block. LunchtYme gives Yalies the option to opt-in each day to a service that matches them with one or more of a pre-selected subset of their current Facebook friends for lunch at the exact time and place that is most convenient for each of them. Stop pretending that you are "going to grab lunch": extend your social network off of Facebook and into LunchtYme.
