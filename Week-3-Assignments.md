Total time estimated: `4-8 hours`

##Assignment 5 - Learn Git
`3-6 hours`

By the end you should be comfortable:
- Explaining what git is used for and generally how it works
- Committing changes to a branch
- Correcting mistakes in the committing process
- Explaining how tags/branches work
- Working with branches - creating them, committing changes to them, and merging them back to the 1st branch

Please become familiar using git this week. I'd recommend:
- `10 min` Videos 1 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/videos> - to give you a better idea of what git is for and why we use it
- `15 min` interactive tutorial: <http://try.github.io/> (just blaze through this to get a feel for it - gitimmersion is much more thorough)
  - There are a few other guides like this here: <http://guides.github.com/>
- `2-4 hours` This thorough interactive tutorial: <http://gitimmersion.com/>
  - Do through and including lab 35. This is more than the previously assigned 23.
  - Of all of the resources, you will definitely learn the most through gitimmersion.
  - This one focuses on using git locally, you should work beyond this to actually push changes to github.
- `1 hour` Chapters 1, 2 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/book> - to explain things in detail, especially if you have questions beyond gitimmersion. At a minimum you should skim the headers of this to see what's there, it's a great reference.
- `1 hour` 
  - Create a public repository named "gittraining" on your github account
  - Use this to go through gitimmersion. Gitimmersion focuses on local git (not pushing to github)
- `15 min` When you're done with gitimmersion, please push your code to github by following this guide: <https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote>
  - If that guide isn't totally helpful, please ask a question(/answer) on Piazza! :)
- `5 min` This cute interactive diagram (5 min) will give you an overview of git workflow. I'd recommend using this last, to tie together concepts from the earlier resources. <http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/>


##Assignment 6 - GitHub Pages
`1 hour`
To apply the git knowledge you're working on this week, please put your personal website from week 1 on a personal github page. You can follow this guide. 

2. 


###Challenge
Most people in the course shouldn't spend time on this right now, and it's not required.

Since this course has a diverse set of people with different levels of programming experience, I'll include some "challenge" assignments. If you think you can handle doing some additional work, this would be a great way to become more comfortable in Ruby.

Try completing one of the Project Euler problems in ruby ^_~

## Submission
`5 minutes`

When you are done, do the following

1. Submit your **time worked** for each of the two assignments on the class google form (Found on the [[Assignments]] page).
2. Submit your github page to us by putting your name in the list below.
