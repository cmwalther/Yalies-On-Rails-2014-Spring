Total time estimated: `4-8 hours`

##Assignment 5 - Learn Git
`3-6 hours`

By the end you should be comfortable:
- Explaining what git is used for and generally how it works
- Committing changes to a branch
- Correcting mistakes in the committing process
- Explaining how tags/branches work
- Working with branches - creating them, committing changes to them, and merging them back to the 1st branch

Please become familiar using git this week. I'd recommend:
- `10 min` Videos 1 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/videos> - to give you a better idea of what git is for and why we use it
- `15 min` interactive tutorial: <http://try.github.io/> (just blaze through this to get a feel for it - gitimmersion is much more thorough)
  - There are a few other guides like this here: <http://guides.github.com/>
- `2-4 hours` This thorough interactive tutorial: <http://gitimmersion.com/>
  - Do through and including lab 35. This is more than the previously assigned 23.
  - Of all of the resources, you will definitely learn the most through gitimmersion.
  - This one focuses on using git locally, you should work beyond this to actually push changes to github.
- `1 hour` Chapters 1, 2 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/book> - to explain things in detail, especially if you have questions beyond gitimmersion. At a minimum you should skim the headers of this to see what's there, it's a great reference.


##Assignment 6 - Learn GitHub & GitHub Pages
`<1 hour`

To apply the git knowledge you're working on this week,

- `20 min` 
  - Follow this guide: <https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote>
  - Create a public repository named "gittraining" on your github account
  - Push the repository you were using in gitimmersion to this branch. All commits should end up being "pushed" to the server
  - If that guide isn't totally helpful, please ask a question(/answer) on Piazza! :)
- `20 min` Put your personal website from week 1 on a personal github page. You can follow this guide.
  - <www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/> (choose "already have code" and "user pages")
  - Also checkout the github help articles about "GitHub pages" if you need additional information. <https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles>
  - You can spend some time making your site more presentable if you'd like, but that's optional.
- `5 min` Go through this cute interactive diagram. I'd recommend using this last, to tie together concepts from the earlier resources and solidify why they're useful.

##Assignment 7 - More Ruby
`1-2 hours`

###Ruby Exercises
Everyone should go through some more exercises to continue getting comfortable with Ruby.

###Ruby Challenge
Most people in the course shouldn't spend time on this right now, and it's not required.

Since this course has a diverse set of people with different levels of programming experience, I'll include some "challenge" assignments. If you think you can handle doing some additional work, this would be a great way to become more comfortable in Ruby.

Try completing one of the Project Euler problems in ruby ^_~

## Submission
`5 minutes`

When you are done, do the following

1. Submit your **time worked** for each of the two assignments on the class google form (Found on the [[Assignments]] page).
2. Submit your github page and gittraining repositories to us by putting your name in the list below.

###Github Pages
- Casey Watts (caseywatts.github.io)
  - If you're curious, I use Jekyll to host a blog on my github pages, but I still have a "user page" here: <http://www.caseywatts.com>

###Git training repositories
- Casey Watts (github.com/caseywatts/gittraining) (I don't have one but yours will look like this)
