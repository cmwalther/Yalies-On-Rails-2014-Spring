###Challenge
Most people in the course shouldn't spend time on this right now, and it's not required.

Since this course has a diverse set of people with different levels of programming experience, I'll include some "challenge" assignments. If you think you can handle doing some additional work, this would be a great way to become more comfortable in Ruby.

Try completing one of the Project Euler problems in ruby ^_~
