## Description

For this project, your goal is to build a Rails app with features mimicking a site of your choosing. The site should be of reasonable complexity, but you don't have to include all features of the site you're mimicking.

Some suggested sites:
* Twitter (David, Aaron, Andrew)
* Reddit
* Kickstarter (excluding payments)
* Tumblr
* Bing (j/k)
* or anything you choose (with approval)

You should form teams of three, and fork this [project1 repository](https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/project1).

Before you begin building, please discuss your plan with Adam.
