## Tracking Time

We'd appreciate it if you track the time you spend on each assignment (including any listed readings and the work itself). You can do this in any way you would like. If you would like a tool to help you, you might try [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com).

You can submit your time information through this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r3Ymzl-VhsW_o9EMp7GoRDtLfIhTVaQZ5CNTioyzA5M/viewform)
