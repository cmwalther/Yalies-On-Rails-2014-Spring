### Tracking Time

We'd appreciate it if you track the time you spend on each assignment (including any listed readings and the work itself). You can do this in any way you would like. If you would like a tool to help you, you might try [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com).

Please submit your time information through this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r3Ymzl-VhsW_o9EMp7GoRDtLfIhTVaQZ5CNTioyzA5M/viewform). Some weeks may have multiple "assignments" numbered, see the week's assignments page for specifics.
