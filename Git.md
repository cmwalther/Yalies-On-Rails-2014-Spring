## Resources

* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) - A great next step to take what you learned in 'Try Git' and apply it to your own computer.
* [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) - A solid, complete reference to Git.
* [The Git Flow model](http://nvie.com/archives/323) - We follow this methodology of creating branches for features, bug fixes, development, etc.

### Advanced
* [Git from the bottom up](http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf) - This is geared for those of you with strong CS backgrounds who want to learn how git really works. It's interesting, but definitely **optional**.
