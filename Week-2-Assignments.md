## Assignment 3 - Ruby Koans

###Reading
Read Chapter 4 of *Agile Web Development with Rails 4th Ed.* (it's in the shared Google Docs folder). (We'll read Chapters 2 - 3 for Assignment 6, so you can skip them for now if you want.)

You may optionally want to look at [Ruby section of the resources page](https://github.com/yale-stc-developer-curriculum/YEI-STC-Bootcamp-2013/wiki/Resources#ruby) for more reading. Below are selected suggestions from that page:

* If you want a clearly written intro to programming concepts (using Ruby), I suggest [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) by Chris Pine
  * There's an e-book version in the shared Google Docs folder
* If you want something quirky and fun, I suggest [Why's Poignant Guide Chapter](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/)
* For a more advanced / complete treatment of the Ruby language (if you're feeling adventurous), I suggest [Programming Ruby (The Pickaxe Book)](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0). This is also a great reference book if you have questions about a specific part of the language.

###Koans
Your assignment is to complete a portion of the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) (see note below before downloading). Specifically, you should complete all the koans through the section (i.e. file) called `about_iteration.rb`.

If you would like to have them run automatically, you could try to use the trick described here:
