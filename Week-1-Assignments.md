###Assignment 1 - Create a Personal HTML/CSS Site
`< 5 hours`

For this assignment, you should design and build a simple website introducing yourself to the class. At a minimum you should use at least 5 types of html tags and 5 types of css styles. If you already know any JS, this is a good time to put in a javascript function or two. You could spend an infinite amount of time on this, but please limit yourself to just a few hours, 5 maximum.

As part of this assignment, you should read through and refer to both the [Basic and Advanced Guides to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com).


###Assignment 2 - The Command Line
`3-5 hours`

1. Read over the wiki page [[Command Line]].
2. Complete this walkthrough guide called [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). 

Your assignment assignment is to work through this guide. Make sure to actually type in all the **Do This** parts, *and* do the **Do More** sections. We can't stress enough that proficiency in the command line is important, and this guide will really help you become proficient if you actively follow it (as opposed to just reading it).

We chose this as your first assignment for a few reasons:

* It's on a fundamental skill that everything else in this course depends on.
* To show you that in this course, and in development in general, *the internet is your textbook*.
    * We'll have lectures, and in some cases we'll provide written summaries or guides to topics, but often, the best resources are out there already.
* Learning to program requires a lot of **doing** and **self-teaching**. I'll serve as your guide and help you when you get stuck, but a lot of this material requires work and practice on your part.


Also, we just want to note and re-assure you that almost every future assignment will require more creativity and building your own work (as opposed to just following instructions like in this assignment).

## Submission
