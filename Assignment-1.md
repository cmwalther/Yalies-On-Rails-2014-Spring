###Create a Personal HTML/CSS Site
For this assignment, you should design and build a simple website introducing yourself to the class. You know, like a MySpace profile (you guys remember that, right?).

The site should use HTML, CSS, and a small bit of JavaScript (optional, but if you have any JS experience or want to learn more I encourage you to do so). It should have at least 2 different pages, and they should link to each other. You'll want to include some images, and make it interesting and aesthetically pleasing (for relative definitions of pleasing). :)

As part of this assignment, you should read through and refer to both the [Basic and Advanced Guides to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com).
